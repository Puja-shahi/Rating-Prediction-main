15030,4,Just 6K INR for a Wi-Fi v6 router is a steal
15031,4,No heating issue anymore. Please read how I solved the issue Happy I bought the TP-Link AX 3000
15032,4,My review AX3000: not bad for a futureproof router.
15033,4,Decent for its price
15034,4,Mesh Technology
15035,4,"Smart mode works great, most of the time"
15036,4,The new version lacks MU-MIMO
15037,4,Go for WiFi 6 mesh routers to be future proof
15038,3,Solved Wifi issues
15039,3,Future Proof Router
15040,3,"Perfect, however with some stability issues"
